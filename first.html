                <p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were eight international 
                   development goals for the year 2015 that had been established following 
                   the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the 
                   adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. These were based 
                   on the OECD DAC International Development Goals agreed by Development 
                   Ministers in the "Shaping the 21st Century Strategy". The Sustainable 
                   Development Goals (SDGs) succeeded the MDGs in 2016.</p>

                   <p>
                    Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. 
                    The eight goals were measured by 21 targets. To accelerate progress, 
                    the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds<br>
                    to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the 
                    African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55 billion in 
                    debt owed by members of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) 
                    to allow<br> them to redirect resources to programs for improving 
                    health.

        <p> Bangladesh Progress Report 2015' is the eighth report monitoring the progress of MDGs in Bangladesh after 2005. The report shows that Bangladesh has registered remarkable progresses in the areas of poverty alleviation, ensuring food security, primary school enrolment, gender parity in primary and secondary level education, lowering the infant and under-five mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio, improving immunization coverage; and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases.

        <p>The attainments of a few targets of MDGs are associated with several
            
            challenges also. The existence of poverty pockets, prevalence of
             unemployment and underemployment among the youth, stunting and
              wasting among the under five children 
              </p>
              <p>
                reducing the dropout rate
                and enhancing the quality of education at the primary level,
                universal access to reproductive health and resource constraints 
                are identified as stumbling blocks in fulfilling all the targets
                 of MDGs in Bangladesh.
